## Gender Classification Using sequential Neural networks

We use the frame level audio features which summarize frequency content within short intervals
of time. Comparatively, more recent music information retrieval tasks take advantage of temporal
structure in audio spectrograms using deep convolutional and recurrent models. a Convolutional
Sequential Neural Network (CNN), is applied to the dataset under a comprehensive set of
conditions. These include audio clip length, which is a novel contribution in this work, and
previously identified considerations such as dataset split and feature level. Additionally, to
showcase the effectiveness of CNN's feature extraction capabilities, we visualize audio samples
at the model’s bottleneck layer demonstrating that learned representations segment into clusters
belonging to their respective artists. Index Terms—artist classification, music, information
retrieval, deep learning, convolutional recurrent neural network
